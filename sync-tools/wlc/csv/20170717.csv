Terra Magica is the story of one region in two countries where wine is bold, strong and full of character !","One region in two countries sets the stage for a story of incredible people and their love for the sun and earth that gives birth to wine. In a fairytale region in western Slovenia, just next to the Italian border, wine has been cultivated even long before the Romans. Many empires have claimed the region in its turbulent past, but the inhabitants have remained strong willed, stubborn and resolute on surviving on their land. Even the two great wars that ravaged the land did not break their will. In West Primorska (Slovenia) wine transcends politics.
